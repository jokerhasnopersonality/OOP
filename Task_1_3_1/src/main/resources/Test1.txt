I'm a patient man
But there's one thing I've been waiting for
My whole god-damn life
My eyes are aching man
But I can't blink, just in case it falls
When I close my eyes

I know I should let go
But there's a part of me that still hopes it can do it
But every time it gets close
It double bounces off of both walls
Uh, uh

I'm still waiting for the DVD logo
To hit the corner of my TV
The little baby's driving me loco
Who knew a graphic could be cheeky?
It's just teasing me
My eyeballs are now crispy to the touch
(I can touch my own eyеballs, is that normal?)
Waiting for the DVD logo
To hit the corner of my TV

I'm not a mad man
I do not spеnd my time exclusively
Watching my TV
I've got a webcam
So I can check on it remotedly and discreetly

It's taken over my life
My wife divorced me
And she took all eight of our kids
I missed the birth of my child
But I just know it would be worth it not to miss

When the cheeky little DVD logo
Hits the corner of my TV
Did you see that one?
Oh heck it, that was so close
I trained one eyeball to be lazy
So I can multi see
My eyeballs are so crispy to the touch
(No amount of liquid can rehydrate them)
I need the DVD logo
To hit the corner of my TV

Sometimes I wonder what will happen when it hits
Will the world stand still or fold into a dream?
Will the DVD logo come to life
And hold me like I held my wife?

I need the DVD logo
To hit the corner of my TV
I'm tired of this permanent prologue
Let me handle what I can see
I can nearly reach
Oh baby, I can feel it
Something's reeling into me
So baby just keep being, don't police your energy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, haa, ooh, ooh, ooh
